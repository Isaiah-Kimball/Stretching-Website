# Stretching-Website
The following website is designed for users to keep track of their stretching progress and also having the ability to learn new stretches based upon regions of the body. All images used fall under fair use and were used from sources that do not require citation (iStock, pixaBay, pexels, unsplash).

This project is still in development and currently represents basic HTML, CSS, and JS knowledge, but I am still adding and planning on more features (though most require backend data which I am currently learning).

# Features
Current features include a navigation bar to go to a specific section, lots of information pertaining to stretching, a variety of stretches with the areas covered and the pros and cons of doing the stretch listed, and a section to toggle which areas the user doesn't want to stretch, or see relavent stretches to

# Features to Come
Features to come include, a discussion forum that allows users to share their stretching journey with other people and allow people to ask questions pertaining to flexibility. More pages will be made pertaining to specific practices that utilize stretching including martial arts, yoga, and sports. A sort of leveling system based on the user's consistency using the site, the ability to create your own stretching plans, the ability to post images of your stretching progress and to share with others, and badges to show your completion of certain stretches (like being able to do the full splits for instance). And of course, more stretches will need to be added.

# Why did I make this Website?
I made this website because I personally am trying to keep track of my stretching journey, and the majority of other sites that offer this service are either pay to use, or are missing some features, or are just unsatisfactory in my opinion. Because of these reasons, I wanted to make my own website that even other people can use too (and also to gain experience with Webdev)
