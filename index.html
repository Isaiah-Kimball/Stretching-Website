        <h1>The Importance of Stretching</h1>
        <p>Stretching is a necessity for proper health. Without proper stretching, your mobility, as you age, can decrease, and you may ev
            experience pain in regions of your body. There's a saying that goes "Mobility is Freedom", and it's 100% accurate. 
            Stretching your body can lower your risk of join pain, muscle strain, and improve your muscle health.
        </p>
        <p>
            But one of the most important things to know about strecthing is being safe while doing it. Like the saying goes: "No pain no gain"
            , you will more than likely feel discomfort or some level of pain whenever you stretch. This normal and is something that will lower
            the more that you stretch. You should always listen to your body but at the same time push it. If you're doing the splits, you obviously
            wouldn't just keep legs a little bit apart, you would keep going until you can't spread your legs no more. But you would still want 
            to balance yourself such that you don't slip and pull your muscles.

    <!--This section will discuss the different types of stretching, and which ones to use-->
    <div id = "types" class = "types">
        <h1>The types of stretching</h1>

        <h2>Static Stretching</h2>
        <p>Static stretching is whenever you hold a stretch without moving for a period of time, like when you bend to touch your toes</p>
        
        <h2>Passive Stretching</h2>
        <p>Very similar to static stretching in that you hold a stretch position for a set time, but usually includes another
            stretching tool such as a resistance band or another person (can be used to push yourself beyond your mobility limits)
        </p>
        
        <h2>Active Stretching</h2>
        <p>Active Stetching is whenever you contract one group of muscle(s) while you stretch another.
            An example would be extending your arms parallel to the floor and pulling yourself back to stretch your ches
        </p>

        <h2>Isometric Stretching</h2>
        <p>Isometric Stetching is when a muscle is being contracted whenever you are not moving another part of your body.
            An example would be stretching your quad by pulling your ankle to the back of your glute.
        </p>
        <h2>Dynamic Stretching</h2>
        <p>Dynamic Stretching is essentially moving your muscles through their full range of motion and is when you are
            actively moving your muscles and stretching them at the same time.
